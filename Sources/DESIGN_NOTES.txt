There should not really be any instances of static variables.

All information should be stored in contexts that are passed in from main or something.

Something in engine.h likely is the overall container for the contexts.

"transaction log" -- track every step of the world so we can step backwards in time?

REMEMBER: KINC IS THE ABSTRACTION LAYER!!!! You don't need to wrap something that's already wrapping everything else!!!!
